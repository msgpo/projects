# sudomesh projects

**status**: This document is a process proposal and has not been decided upon

We can increase the impact of sudomesh by taking on projects as a whole team, working together on them, and documenting  and celebrating their completion.

At the same time, it can actually decrease output by taking on too many projects at once or working on ambiguously-defined projects whose team members may not agree on objectives and non-goals. So it's important to fully define projects before taking them on.

Taking on a project is taking on the goal to complete the project, so [SMART criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) apply.

If you have an idea for a project, and want to define it and get others on board to work on it with you, why not start by adding a folder or text file under [./proposals](./proposals)?

Once you've defined it, make a PR to move the file under [./backlog](./backlog) to be prioritized.

As projects complete, we can pull new projects from ./backlog to [./in-progress](./in-progress).

And finally, we can look back (at the end of the year, or when building newsletters, fundraising) at our completed projects in [./done](./done).
