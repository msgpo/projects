Consider using this template for your proposals.

# Project Title

Sponsor: Your Name

## Summary:

A short description

## Supporters

Supporters: Others who you've talked to about this and are eager to help. Have any supporters made commitments to help in specific ways? Note that here.

## Milestones

Big projects can be hard. Smaller ones are easier. If you had to split this one up, what milestones would you have? For example, prototyping, availability for testing, production-quality release. How long might each milestone take?

Milestones serve as leading indicators of the whole project. i.e. if we're behind on a milestone, we can infer the project as a whole may need some help, without either the project dragging on indefinitely, or only learning things are off track at the end.

## Graduation Criteria

How will we know that this has succeeded?
Gathering user feedback is crucial for building high quality experiences and SIGs have the important responsibility of setting milestones for stability and completeness.
