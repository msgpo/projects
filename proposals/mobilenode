Proposal to spend ~$800-900 on a mobile Calyx node to be first deployed at the new Village site near Coliseum. Will be returned once we establish line of sight to a neighbor open to sharing their bandwidth (or reach it via Paxio link to the hills).

These specs researched by @juul:

# Recurring fees

$400 per year for [Calyx membership](https://www.calyxinstitute.org/member/membership-levels).

Jenny will also explore [becoming an organizational partner](https://www.calyxinstitute.org/about/partners).

Battery will have to be replaced every couple of years.

# One-time purchases

## Calyx Membership

There's an extra $100 one-time fee for the first year of the Calyx membership.

## 4G LTE modem

Cost: $125 + tax and shipping

Yes unfortunately a decent modem that works on the weird U.S. frequencies _is_ that expenseive.

## Wifi Router with 4G LTE modem slot

Cost: $46 + tax and shipping

We don't _need_ this. We can just use an adapter to plug our modem into USB of anything we like (including a My Net n600) but then we'll need a couple of antennas and pigtails so it might end up costing just as much. The only good reason not to use this router is if we can lower the power consumption.

Power: We know that the usage can peak above 12 W since these are 12 V units and they used to ship them with 1 A power supplies and switched to 2 A because they would sometimes have issues during peak usage with a 1 A supply. Let's assume peak consumption of e.g. 15 W. The average is probably quite a bit below that, let's guess at 8 W.

## Outdoor container

I think we have some we can re-purpose.

## Solar panel

Cost: Depends on what we end up buying. Urban ore has panels at 60 cents per watt so probably up to $100.

We will probably need at least a 100 W solar panel if we want to run 24/7 365. We can get away with a lot less if we're willing to have dropouts during the night in the darkest parts of winter.

## Battery

We can probably get away with a 12 V 10 Ah battery. I think we have one.

## Solar charge controller

Cost: We might have one at sudo but otherwise around $40

## Cables, plugs and mounting brackets

Cost: Maybe another $30.
